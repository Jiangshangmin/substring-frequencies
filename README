This program takes two files as inputs, and prints the strings that occur at
least twice in the first input, together with the number of times they occur in
the second input.

The user can provide thresholds so that only strings thatat occur at least X
times in input 1 are printed, and only strings that occur at most Y times in
input 2 are printed.

Example run:

  $ ./substring-frequencies --skip-prefixes \
    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-3 \
    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2 \
    30 0
  35	0	 conve
  34	0	 convey
  30	0	 covered work
  36	0	covered work
  37	0	ered w
  36	0	ered work
  36	0	overed work
  37	0	red w
  36	0	red work
  36	0	vered work

This command finds all substrings of GPL-3 that occur at least 30 times in that
text, but also never occur in GPL-2.  We can tell that "covered work" and
"convey" are important terms in GPL-3, although they were never mentioned in
GPL-2.

The `--skip-prefixes' option prevents listing "covered wor" when "covered work"
is already listed, provided both have the exact same positive counts.
